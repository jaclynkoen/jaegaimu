I've just read Monad Transformers Step by Step ( and I'm trying to combine `State` with `Except` in a program that I'm writing, but when I try to implement the pattern, I get completely lost. So can anyone recommend some places where I can see examples of monad transformers used, either in the real world or in tutorial. Discover our range of transformers from medium voltage up to 170kV. Our expertise in transformers translates into reliable products for any application. Hi everyone, I've been working on designing an opticoupled zero cross detector for 120VAC, and the other day someone on here suggested wiring a current sensing transformer (1:1000 ratio) in reverse. I'd love to have more discussion with the community on this concept specifically. I've drawn up a schematic and some calculations here ( The transformer I've been eyeballing is here (http://www.digikey.com/scripts/DkSearch/dksus.dll?DetailampitemSeq=193153944ampuq=6.

I've written a couple pieces of monadic code, (State, IO, Parser) and I'm at the point where I want to understand how to stack monads using transformers. So I'm reading through Martin Grabmuller's excellent paper ( (I found the literate haskell file ( separately.) It seems a library must have changed since he wrote this in 2006. He notes that:

I have a ton of RPGs as PDFs or EPubs. I was wondering if people had suggestions as to what the best tablet would be for reading/storing these RPGs. Since I would basically only be using the tablet for reading text, I dont need something as nice (or expensive) at the iPad, so I was thinking about just a kindle, but apparently those suck when it comes to reading PDFs (and cant handle Epubs.)

Out of curiosity, rather than build the complicated (less simple) circuits I've seen for using current monitors with an Arduino, I hooked a TAK17-02 current transformer's secondary coil pins (1 amp 2 out of 4) straight to the AC input of a GBL005 bridge rectifier. Metering the +- outputs of the rectifier while the TAK is on a 240VAC circuit that my clamp meter says was pulling 19 AMPs gave me 0.5 VDC and no current. With the TAK on a 120VAC circuit pulling 1.9 AMPs the +- pins of the rectifi. The Transformers - The Autobot Smasher! Read more. CAPACITORS MAGNETIC CIRCUITS AND TRANSFORMERS. I've been on the fence over the past few weeks about purchasing a 10-inch Honeycomb tablet. So, I'm curious about what you guys think about yours. I know the specs and all, but do you use it often and, if so, why do you use it over your laptop? How practical is it? I'm afraid I'll drop 0, use it for a week, and continue using my laptop prominently. Also, I've been attracted to the 7" Amazon Fire recently, any thoughts from a 7" tablet user? I have a Droid X, so I feel the difference wouldn'. 8.
